R is an open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more. R is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and researchers for data analysis, visualization, and modeling, as well as by businesses and organizations for data-driven decision-making. R is highly extensible, with a vast library of user-contributed packages available for download, and it can also interface with other programming languages like Python and C++.
